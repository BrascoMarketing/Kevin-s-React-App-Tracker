# Fitness Tracker

A simple, fully offline fitness tracker built with React and Tailwind CSS.  
Log exercises, track progress by day, and build your exercise library â€” all stored in your browser's LocalStorage.

- Categorize exercises by default loaded Push, Pull, and Legs categories
- OR Create your own custom categories and assign exercises to one or many categories
- Choose which day of the week the category will use (Everyday defaults to "Rest" day)
- Log sets with reps and weight for any day
- Designate exercises as 'body weight' and the "Weight" input will prepopulate
- Mark exercises as completed (with commit-style confirmation)
- Navigate forward or backward through days to review or add logs
- All data stored locally in your browser's LocalStorage (no account required)
- Dark Mode Only UI (because light mode is banned here)
